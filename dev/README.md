Jenkins- Terraform- Packer with ASG-ELB-EC2 + PHP Testing (not Ansible here)

This example does not use packer and its scripts under this directory.


Setting up AWS named profiles
To be able to apply the changes, weâ€™ll create a named profile for each environment (Workspace).

Note: Terraform developers decided to use the word Workspace instead of Environment due to the overuse of this word,


terraform graph
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
terraform state list | grep aws_lb_target_group
terraform destroy -target module.pilot1.aws_lb_target_group.target_es

terraform state push

# We created before our tfstate file so we need to convert local state to remote state (and store our state in the s3 bucket we created):


Ensure this is a clean environment with no .terraform directory in the module root path
configure two backend.tfvars files
run terraform init -backend-config=./backend-prod.tfvars
you will see a successful initialization
run terraform init -backend-config=./backend-dev.tfvars
you will see the migrate all workspaces to s3? message





# hands on
- disable the backend (s3)
terraform workpace list
terraform workspace new dev || true
terraform workspace new prod || true
terraform workspace list 

terraform select dev && terraform init
terraform select prod && terraform init
terraform show
